## üöÄ Usage

### Manual Module Usage

1. **Import the module and initialize it in the root of your app:**

   ```jsx
   import { initializeSDK } from 'react-native-converted-in-sdk';

   initializeSDK({
     pixelId: 'your_pixel_id',
     storeUrl: 'your_store_url',
   });
   ```

2. **Use the SDK methods in your components:**

   ```jsx
   import { identifyUser } from 'react-native-converted-in-sdk';

   const Component = () => {
     React.useEffect(() => {
       // Example usage of SDK functions
       identifyUser("test@test.com", "+91", "9876543210");
     }, []);

     // Your component logic here
   };
   ```

### Usage with Hook

1. **Wrap your app with `RNConvertInSDKProvider`:**

    ```jsx
    export default function App() {
      return (
        <RNConvertInSDKProvider
          pixelId="your_pixel_id"
          storeUrl="your_store_url"
        >
          <AppContent />
        </RNConvertInSDKProvider>
      );
    }
    ```

2. **Use the `useConvertedInSdk` hook in your components:**

    ```jsx
    import { useConvertedInSdk } from 'react-native-converted-in-sdk';

    const Component = () => {
      const { identifyUser } = useConvertedInSdk();

      React.useEffect(() => {
        // Example usage of SDK functions
        identifyUser("test@test.com", "+91", "9876543210");
      }, []);

      // Your component logic here
    };
    ```
